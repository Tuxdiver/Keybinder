Keybinder
=========

Bind IR remote control to shell commands

This script reads /dev/input/eventX on a linux system and starts commands, when a configured 
key was recognized.


The configuration for the inputs is working for a HAMA remote control with the USB signature:
  
  Bus 002 Device 005: ID 05a4:9881 Ortek Technology, Inc.

and the commands-file will change the colors and settings of an running hyperion ambilight daemon.
